## Dream Search Website

*The technologies I used for this website were:* 
 - HTML
 - SCSS

The site is already running on netlify, you can check it out here: [Dreamsearch Website](https://dreamsearch.netlify.app/)

If you want to run it locally, you may run a live server of the index.html to play around with it or you  might just open the index.html file.
